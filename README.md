## About Hautherion Token

This is a toy project that I used to learn how to work with the ERC-20 standard as well as how to hook up a front end application, using ethers.js, with a deployed smart contract.

HAUTH was implemented following the ERC-20 token standard and currently runs on the Ethereum Rinkeby Test network. It has a capped supply of 100 million tokens and every time a transaction is mined, it rewards 25 HAUTH.
